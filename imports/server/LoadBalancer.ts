// This implements a simple multi-process, single-machine load-balancer.
//
// It serves as a drop-in replacement for the relevant subset of the
// `meteorhacks:cluster` package we used (which was mostly just "load balance
// across a pool of processes, so we can use all the cores on a machine").
//
// The coordinator runs in the main process, and may spawn several worker
// processes (which will have behavior modulated by having CLUSTER_WORKER_ID set
// in their environment).
//
// The coordinator intercepts HTTP and Websocket requests, and may dispatch them
// to worker processes over `child_process` messaging.
//
// If CLUSTER_WORKERS_COUNT is set in the environment, it spawns that many child
// processes, or if set to "auto", spawns as many children as the machine has
// CPUs.
//
// Otherwise, it spawns no children, and the listeners simply propagate the
// requests as middleware usually do, which causes the requests to be serviced
// from the main process.
